# Alvea - Revolutionizing User Interaction with AI

| About Alvea | 🥇 1st Place Winning Team |
| --- | --- |
| **Alvea is an innovative application designed to enhance productivity and user experience by leveraging generative user interfaces.**<br/><br/>Developed during [Generative UI hackathon](https://partiful.com/e/1antxX3cgLArJFGRNKg4) at [AGI House SF](https://agihouse.ai/), Alvea addresses the limitations of existing AI chat applications by offering dynamic, just-in-time user interfaces that adapt to the user's tasks and needs. |   |

## The Problem

Existing AI chat apps, while boosting productivity, fall short in delivering optimal collaborative and informational experiences due to their reliance on text-based communication.

## Our Solution

Alvea emerges as a solution to this problem by integrating AI to develop dynamically rendering user interfaces that are interactive and tailored to the user's current task.

### Key Features

<!-- - **Dynamic User Interfaces:** Unlike static interfaces, Alvea's UIs are interactive and adapt based on the input, providing a more efficient way to convey information and extract user preferences.
- **Visual Components:** Alvea incorporates appropriate visual components for task accomplishment, allowing for a collaboration between the AI and the user that surpasses traditional text-based interactions.
- **Customized Experience:** Focused on delivering the best customer experience, Alvea enables language models to visualize and communicate in the most effective way for every task. -->

    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
    <strong>Task:</strong>
    <blockquote>"I want to plan a trip to lake tahoe for 2"</blockquote>
    <br/><br/>
    Alvea streamlines trip planning by combining interactive forms for inputting travel preferences with a visual map component, showcasing destinations and points of interest with markers for an intuitive planning experience.

    <td colspan="2">
    <strong>Task:</strong>
    <blockquote>"I'm trying to plan my new home theater room, 5.1.2 dolby atmos. Where should I put my speakers?"</blockquote>
    <br/>
    For home theater enthusiasts, Alvea captures room specifications through a simple form and employs AI code generation to show a 3D visualization of the room, enabling users to virtually place speakers and optimize their audio setup with precision and ease.
